**1- HTML** file : It contains the structure of the page in this order ->

>> * Inside the main, there are three sections : 
>>> * Section1 : contains the hero image.
>>> * Section2 : contains three images or cards that hold the image.
>>> * Section3 : contains a one image, one button and one text.
